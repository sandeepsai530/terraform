Manual Infra:
- Time

Version control can be achieved by using Terraform like infra-1.0 , infra-2.0
previous version can be restored in less time if something is wrong.
Inventory management - you can understand the resources by seeing terraform files.
Dependency Management - Terraform can understand the dependency between resources. First it will create dependencies and then actual resources.
Code reusable - terraform modules, you can create similar infra for any number of projects using modules.
