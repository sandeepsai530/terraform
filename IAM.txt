#cross account s3 buckets communication
Scenario:
Account A (Source) â€” owns Bucket A
Account B (Destination) â€” owns Bucket B
You want to copy or sync data between these two buckets.

- Step 1: Give Permission via Bucket Policy (Destination Account)
In Account B, attach this bucket policy to Bucket B so Account A can write data into it.

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowAccountAToPutObjects",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<AccountA-ID>:root"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:PutObjectAcl"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-b-name/*"
    }
  ]
}


ðŸ”¹ This allows Account A to upload data into Bucket B.
ðŸ”¹ Replace <AccountA-ID> and bucket-b-name accordingly.

- Step 2: IAM Role or User Policy in Account A
In Account A, the IAM Role or User copying data should have permission to read from Bucket A and write to Bucket B.

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-a-name/*"
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:PutObject", "s3:PutObjectAcl"],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bucket-b-name/*"
    }
  ]
}
